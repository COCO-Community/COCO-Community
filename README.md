## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🧐 COCO Community is a Decentralised Autonomous Organization by a a community of CORETOSHIS As Pioneer miners of Satoshi, which metamorphosed into CORE we felt a need to solve 3 problems which are Build the capacity of the community with appropriate blockchain education - COCO Blockchain Essentials Course at Norssken House Kigali, Rwanda Build and online marketplace to have a homegrown solution to intra-afrcan global trade which accepts blockchain based payments and fiat having missed out of the golden Bitcoin Era of 50BTC block rewards and knowing that by 2032 99% of $BTC will be almready mined, we decided to set up a BITCOIN mining farm 🔭
